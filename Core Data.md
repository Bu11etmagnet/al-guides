# Core Data Guide
This guide is meant to serve as a reference point for making purchases from the Core Data Exchange. Core data is one of the primary sources of end-game equipment, and is acquired primarily as a reward for completing daily hardmode maps. As such, it's imperative that you always complete your daily hardmodes.
