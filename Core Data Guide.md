# Core Data Guide
This guide is meant to serve as a reference point for making purchases from the Core Data Exchange. Core data is one of the primary sources of end-game equipment, and is acquired primarily as a reward for completing daily hardmode maps. As such, it's imperative that you always complete your daily hardmodes.

Equipment is listed in shop stock order and not grouped by purchase priority.

For more detailed information, see the Equipment Guide and Auxiliary Guide.

## Purchasable Ships and Other Luxuries
In general, core data is best saved for guaranteed equipment, as that equipment is often incredibly strong and cannot be acquired anywhere else. The ships found in the core data shop can be acquired through farming maps in the war archives. While they cannot be readily acquired from other sources, the tech level 5 equipment packs represent a poor value proposition, given that they're still beholden to the same equipment pools as any other equipment pack, with many of the available gold pieces being either completely useless or outclassed by research or core data equipment.

Cognition chips are a well-justified value proposition. Their core data cost is relatively low relative to the quantity of chips acquired. However, the actual applicability of cognition chips is going to be a very personal issue, and purchasing chips is likely only worthwhile for the most dedicated players.

## Recommended Primary Equipment
[![Prototype 203mm Twin No.3](/resources/pr203mm%20mounted%20no3%20no_gr.png)]()
[![Fairey Firefly](/resources/firefly%20no_gr.png)]()
[![Swordfish (818 Squadron)](/resources/swordfish%20818%20no_gr.png)]()
[![Seiran](/resources/seiran%20no_gr.png)]()
 - **Prototype 203mm Twin No.3** - While arguably obsoleted by the research 203mm Mle1934, the No.3 is still worth buying, especially as a newer player, given the relative boost in power it provides relative to its ease of acquisition.
 - **Fairey Firefly** - A relatively fast dive bomber with exceptionally strong anti-air guns. Has niche usage when airstrike AA and/or faster airstrike reload speed is desired.
 - **Fairey Swordfish (818 Squadron)** - The most generally useful parallel spread torpedo bomber. Its utility makes it a generally superior option to the relatively more difficult to acquire Fairey Barracuda when using a Ryuusei or Tenzan would be impractical. Also strong in PVP.
 - **Seiran** - Strongest seaplane bomber in the game. Purchase if you use BBVs or I-13.

## Recommended Auxiliary Equipment
[![Type 93 Oxygen Torpedo](/resources/oxytorp%20no_gr.png)]()
[![Type 1 AP Shell](/resources/t1%20shell%20no_gr.png)]()
[![SHS](/resources/sh%20shell%20no_gr.png)]()
[![Snorkel](/resources/snorkel%20no_gr.png)]()
[![Seal of the Four Gods](/resources/seal%20of%20four%20gods%20no_gr.png)]()
[![Homing Beacon](/resources/homing%20beacon%20no_gr.png)]()
 - **Type 93 Oxygen Torpedo** - The strongest offensive aux for nearly every vanguard unit equipped with torpedoes. Its high-rarity makes upgrading it relatively difficult and as such, treat it as a long-term commitment. Long-term oxytorp goals are 4 or so for vanguard usage and between 3-6 for submarine fleets.
 - **Type 1 Armour-Piercing Shell** - The strongest offensive aux for main fleet artillery support. Equipping one on every battleship in current use should be considered a default. Purchase accordingly.
 - **Super-Heavy Shell** - The strongest offensive aux combo for main fleet artillery support is a T1 shell alongside a SHS. Given the existence of other especially useful auxiliary equips for these ships, SHS represents a weaker value prospect than T1 shells.
 - **Improved Snorkel** - A strong offensive aux for calling submarines into combat. Its usefulness will depend on the submarines you're using and the torpedoes they're equipped with. Purchase only if you already understand submarine mechanics and purchase no more than 3.
 - **Seal of the Four Gods** - Boosts main gun damage and barrage statistics when equipped to the An Shan class. Given their weak torpedoes, this auxiliary equip easily overtakes the oxytorp as the strongest offensive aux for them specifically. Purchase if you use them.
 - **Homing Beacon** - Incredibly useful aux for carriers. Should be considered default equipment for trash clearing fleets and PVP. Purchase accordingly.

## Questionable Equipment
[![SBD Dauntless (McClusky)](/resources/dauntless%20mcclusky%20no_gr.png)]()
[![100/150 AV Gas](/resources/av%20gas%20no_gr.png)]()
[![Type 98 FDD](/resources/t98%20fdd%20no_gr)]()
[![TBM Avenger (ASW)](/resources/tbm%20avenger%20asw%20no_gr.png)]()
 - **SBD Dauntless (McClusky)** - The damage boost against carriers doesn't make up for the loss in base damage compared to a more damage-focused bomber like the SB2C Helldiver with one specific exception: Ark Royal. Ark's dive bomber slot represents a small enough portion of her damage that the damage boost becomes relevant for her and her alone.
 - **100/150 Aviation Gas** - Only useful in PVP.
 - **Type 98 Firing Delay Device** - Reduces spread of the main gun by a negligible amount. Has potential to improve clear consistency and therefore average clear time in incredibly select scenarios, but is typically going to be less useful than a different offensive aux.
 - **TBM-3 Avenger (ASW)** - Incredibly strong anti-submarine weapon. Given the relative ease of ASW fights, it's an unnecessary purchase. Treat as a luxury.

## Bad Equipment
[![Improved Storage Battery](/resources/battery%20no_gr.png)]()
[![F2A Buffalo (Thach)](/resources/f2a%20buffalo%20thach%20no_gr.png)]()
[![Barracuda (831 Squadron)](/resources/barracuda%20831%20no_gr.png)]()
[![Skyrocket](/resources/skyrocket%20no_gr.png)]()
[![T94 HA Director](/resources/t94%20director%20no_gr.png)]()
 - **Improved Storage Battery** - Wholly obsoleted by Meowficers, while also occupying a valuable submarine auxiliary slot.
 - **Brewster F2A Buffalo (Thach Squadron)** - No bombs, below-average aa guns, slower than the Me-155A. Its skill effect fails to make up for its downsides.
 - **Fairey Barracuda (831 Squadron)** - What if you took a Suisei, made it deal half damage, and gave its bombs an abysmally low 24% chance to inflict a debuff that increases gunnery damage dealt to the target by 8% for 6s. Hard pass.
 - **Skyrocket** - It go fast.
 - **Type 94 High-Angle Director** - Only good for cooking rice.
