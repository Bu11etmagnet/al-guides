# Auxiliary Equipment Guide
For information on other equipment see the [In-Depth PVE Equipment Guide.](/Equipment%20Guide.md)

This guide for auxiliary equipment is split off from the rest due to the relative depth variety of auxiliary equipment setups. Equipment will not be graded in this guide.

## Defensive Auxiliary Equipment
**Standard Defensive Auxiliaries**<br/>
[![Improved Hydraulic Rudder](/resources/)]()
[![Beaver Badge](/resources/)]()
[![Repair Kit](/resources/)]()
[![Pyoko-Pyoko](/resources/)]()
[![Fuel Filter](/resources/)]()
[![Naval Camo](/resources/)]()
[![Hydraulic Rudder](/resources/)]()

 - **[Improved Hydraulic Rudder]()** is the strongest evasion-focused aux. In addition to having the strongest raw stats boost from a defensive standpoint, this rudder has a 30% chance every 20s to evade all attacks for 2 seconds. Limited to one per ship.
 
 - **[Beaver Squadron Badge]()** provides a similar, but slightly weaker stats boost to the improved rudder. However, it trades the rudder's emergency evasion skill for a permanent fleet-wide speed boost. While the speed boost is only relevant for the vanguard, the boost is active regardless of where the badge is equipped.

 - **[Repair Kit]()** has the highest raw HP boost and slowly restores the equipped ship's HP over time. The heal-over-time from the repair kit can, in certain scenarios, make up for the repair kit providing a weaker raw eHP boost. While the repair kit is not limited per ship, the heal from only a single repair kit can be in effect.

 - **[Pyoko-Pyoko]()** provides the same HP boost as the repair kit, but trades the heal-over-time for a minor luck boost. While the luck boost is incredibly small, because the heal from multiple repair kits cannot stack, pyoko-pyoko becomes an optimal replacement for a repair kit when equipped to a ship who would otherwise gain the highest eHP boost from equipping two auxiliary equips that give this level of HP boost.
 
 - **[Fuel Filter]()** gives a moderate boost to HP and a small boost to evasion, while also having no bonus skill effect. It is suboptimal in nearly every situation.
 
 - **[Naval Camo]()** and **[Hydraulic Rudder]()** provide the exact same stats boost with no bonus skill effect, with a focus on boosting evasion. Despite their low rarity, they are the strongest evasion-focused auxiliary equips after the improved rudder and beaver badge and are not limited per ship.

**Specialty Auxiliaries**<br/>
[![Fire Extinguisher](/resources/)]()
[![Anti-Air Radar](/resources/)]()
[![Repair Crane](/resources/)]()
[![Torpedo Bulge](/resources/)]()
[![Pearl Tears](/resources/)]()

 - **[Fire Extinguisher]()** provides a moderate boost to HP and reduces the chances of a ship catching fire, reduces damage received when on fire, and reduces the duration of burn effects. 
 - **[High-Performance Anti-Air Radar]()** increases anti-air stat. Aside from increasing anti-air damage dealt, the anti-air stat also reduces kamikaze damage received when enemy airplanes crash into your main fleet. Also provides a boost to ambush evasion, similar to SG radar (see below); does not stack with SG radar.
 - **[Repair Crane]()** can only be equipped on repair ships. Every 5s, it heals the most damaged ship in the fleet for a flat 15 HP.
