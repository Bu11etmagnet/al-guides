# Hardmode Ship Guide
This guide serves as a collection of ships that are noteworthy for event hardmode clearing and farming. This is not a tier list per se, but it can serve as a guide for which ships to invest in for event purposes. Ships are rated on a number of criteria related to their applicability in filling ship locks and meeting stat requirements for event hardmodes. It is not meant to imply that all of these ships are on even footing in terms of combat capabilities, and a ship's combat performance is covered in their description.

All listed ships with remodels are assumed to have been remodeled.

See [Fleet Composition Guide](Fleet%20Composition.md) for a more detailed overview of specific ship archetypes.

## Destroyers (DD)
As a general rule, all destroyers have very high evasion stats, making them especially useful for meeting map evasion requirements. Additionally, destroyers also have the highest ASW stats, making them useful in the rare cases when a map demands ASW stats. Their damage distribution being generally weighted towards torpedoes harms their reliability on auto play.

Cassin & Downes
 - Role: Cheap tanky DDs; no stand-out stats
 - Description: The absolute cheapest vanguard units in the game, costing 7 fuel each. While their statlines are generally low, bringing little of value for the sake of filling map stat requirements aside from the fact that destroyers in general have high evasion, their fuel cost makes them incredibly useful as farming ships. Their self-heal ability also makes them the absolute tankiest destroyers over the course of multiple fights. Expect low damage output, but a generalist statline gives them relatively consistent performance on auto control, with decent anti-air output. Differences between the two are marginal and irrelevant, with Cassin only having +3 luck over her sister.

Ayanami
 - Role: Primo torpedo DD; very high torpedo stat
 - Description: One of the strongest torpedo ships in the game. Requires good RNG and manual control for maximum output. Predominantly used for demolishing bosses and filling torpedo stat requirements.
 
Shigure
 - Role: Strong torpedo DD; highest torpedo stat
 - Description: Highest torpedo stat in the game. Weaker torpedo output than Ayanami, but less RNG-reliant and somewhat tankier, making her more reliable (tho still suboptimal) on auto control. Gains bonuses when fielded with Yukikaze.

Kagerou
 - Role: Cheap torpedo DD; very high torpedo stat
 - Description: Buffs the torpedo stat of all ships in the vanguard. While stat buffs like hers apply during combat and therefore are don't impact map stat requirements, it will boost the combat efficacy of any torpedo-equipped ship in the fleet alongside her, especially on manual control. Chain torpedo provides a slight boost to torpedo performance on auto control.

Shiranui
 - Role: Cheap torpedo DD; very high torpedo stat
 - Description: Highest torpedo stat for a base white rarity DD. Provides little bonuses otherwise. Similar to Kagerou, chain torpedo provides a slight boost to torpedo performance on auto control.

Yukikaze
 - Role: Tanky torpedo DD; very high torpedo stat
 - Description: One of the tankiest vanguard units in the game. Her complete lack of RNG elements aside from standard movement AI improves her performance on auto control, but prevents her from having output as high as the other torpedo nuke vanguard units.
 
Z23
 - Role: Tanky gunnery DD; very high general statline
 - Description: Has some of the strongest guns amongst destroyers. Her focus on such with a de-emphasis on torpedo damage greatly improves her performance on auto control. Highest firepower amongst destroyers (still low compared to other vanguard classes), very high anti-air and ASW stats.

Z46
 - Role: Tanky gunnery DD; high torpedo and very high anti-air stats
 - Description: Incredibly strong gunnery output, in large part due to her incredibly potent barrage, alongside strong anti-air output. While her torpedo efficiency is low, her raw torpedo stat is uncharacteristically high, and her barrage also launches homing torpedoes, giving her deceptively high torpedo damage as well.

Javelin
 - Role: Tanky torpedo DD; very high evasion stat and moderately high torpedo stat
 - Description: While her raw torpedo stat doesn't quite match that of her Japanese peers, Javelin's Assault Mode is an incredibly powerful skill, and equipping her with torpedoes that line up with that skill allow her torpedo damage to reach comparable levels of torpedo damage (note: final damage is calculated when the projectile contacts the enemy). Additionally, Javelin brings far superior gunnery damage than her Japanese peers and is a relatively tanky ship with the second highest raw evasion stat in the game.
 
Hammann
 - Role: Cheap anti-air platform; very high anti-air stat
 - Description: Strongest anti-air destroyer in the game, with access to relatively high efficiency, highest in class AA stat, and the anti-air mode skill. This paired with her flagship protection skill give Hammann a strong advantage when attempting to run especially lightweight fleets in any event with a strong enemy aviation presence. While her anti-air output falls behind that of many light cruisers, her most direct competitors are all more expensive to field than her, and the existence of ship locks will sometimes prevent you from fielding one of those light cruisers. Similar to Cassin and Downes, expect low overall damage output, but with the consistency afforded by her efficiencies.

Kitakaze
 - Role: Primo gunnery DD; no stand-out stats
 - Description: While incredibly expensive and nowhere near the top of her class in any given stat relevant for event hardmodes, Kitakaze brings unparalleled damage output. Her ability to overwrite standard damage modifiers for destroyer guns allows her to excel in gunnery damage against medium and heavy armour opponents, giving her massive benefits over other destroyers in environments high in those armour types, especially on auto control. On top of this, she's one of the tankiest destroyers in the game, and still brings respectable torpedo output despite her gunnery focus.

## Light Cruisers (CL)
Light cruisers tend to have a strong balance of stats, while struggling to stand out in specific categories, with a few exceptions. Like with destroyers, cruisers equipped with torpedoes will have superior performance on manual play the more strongly their damage is weighted towards torpedo damage. However, light cruiser guns, while often lacking in raw output compared to other vanguard guns, have amazing ballistics which gives gunboat light cruisers unparalleled consistency on auto. Additionally, light cruisers have ASW stats.

Phoenix
 - Role: Cheap tanky CL; no stand-out stats
 - Description: The light cruiser alternative to Cassin and Downes. Stronger overall, and thanks to her status as a gunboat, more reliable on auto, but slightly more expensive.

Helena
 - Role: Support CL; no stand-out stats
 - Description: One of the strongest support ships in the game. Her debuff skill is incredibly impactful for boss fights, if a bit RNG reliant. Maximum efficacy will require tuning other ships' burst damage windows to line up with Helena's debuff. If you're not willing to put in that amount of effort, use another ship. Not especially tanky nor with especially high base damage, but being a gunboat makes what damage she does have very consistent.

Montpelier
 - Role: Tanky support CL; no stand-out stats
 - Description: The platonic ideal gunboat CL. She's tanky, she buffs other CLs, she has consistent damage output. While her pricetag paired with lack of any noteworthy statistics make her a slightly less appealing option compared to certain other light cruisers from a perspective of maximum efficiency, players who don't mind the extra fuel cost will likely find value in her combat capabilities.
 
San Diego
 - Role: Tanky anti-air cruiser; very high anti-air and anti-submarine stats
 - Description: Absolute strongest single anti-air unit in the game. Sandy also has very strong surface damage output owing to her ability to equip destroyer-caliber guns and sheer volume of fire with both a main gun triggered barrage and timed skill barrage. Sandy also has best-in-class ASW stat.

Leander
 - Role: Cheap support CL; moderately high firepower stat
 - Description: Arguably the most effective cruiser within her cost bracket. Leander has deceptively potent guns between both her efficiency and her artillery command skill, which also buffs any other cruisers in the fleet. Keep in mind that skill-based stat boosts are only active during combat and therefore will not count towards map requirements.
 
Jintsuu
 - Role: Torpedo support CL; very high torpedo stat
 - Description: Best-in-class base torpedo stat and efficiency paired with one of the strongest torpedo buffs in the game, albeit only for destroyers and light cruisers. Her main gun barrage is also strong enough relatively to her base gunnery dpm to justify running a speed gun. The incredibly strong focus on torpedoes encourages manual control to the extent of her IJN destroyer peers.
 
Leipzig
 - Role: Cheap support CL; high general statline
 - Description: Most directly comparable to Leander, but shifts her damage distribution slightly more towards torpedoes, which impacts her auto performance slightly. Tactical command is a stronger skill than artillery command, even for gunboats who gain nothing from the torpedo boost aspect of the skill, and its rarity means she has less immediate competition and can safely be paired with stronger cruisers equipped with artillery command like Wichita or London.
   
Neptune
 - Role: Tanky CL; high general statline
 - Description: Upgunned and upcosted Phoenix. Shifting her damage distribution more heavily towards torpedoes and her barrage (strongest barrage amongst CLs) negatively impacts her auto performance, similar to Jintsuu, but her raw potential is higher enough than Phoenix's to justify her use regardless. If more consistency is desired and locks allow it, consider Minneapolis instead.

Ajax
 - Role: cheap... stat padder?; very high firepower and torpedo stats
 - Description: <i'm struggling to find any real justification for her use aside from her high base stats tbh, ask d2 for some sort of rationalisation>

## Heavy Cruisers (CA)
Light cruisers tend to have a strong balance of stats, while struggling to stand out in specific categories, with a few exceptions. Like with destroyers, cruisers equipped with torpedoes will have superior performance on manual play the more strongly their damage is weighted towards torpedo damage.
