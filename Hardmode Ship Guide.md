# Hardmode Ship Guide
This guide serves as a collection of ships that are, in my opinion, S-tier for event hardmode clearing and farming. This is not a tier list per se, but it can serve as a guide for which ships to invest in for event purposes. Ships are rated on a number of criteria related to their applicability in filling ship locks and meeting stat requirements for event hardmodes. It is not meant to imply that all of these ships are on even footing in terms of combat capabilities, and a ship's combat performance is covered in their description.

All listed ships with remodels are assumed to have been remodeled.

## Destroyers (DD)
As a general rule, all destroyers have very high evasion stats, making them especially useful for meeting map evasion requirements. Additionally, destroyers also have the highest ASW stats, making them useful in the rare cases when a map demands ASW stats. Their damage distribution being generally weighted towards torpedoes harms their reliability on auto play.

Cassin & Downes
 - Role: Cheap tanky destroyers; no stand-out stats
 - Description: The absolute cheapest vanguard units in the game, costing 7 fuel each. While their statlines are generally low, bringing little of value for the sake of filling map stat requirements aside from the fact that destroyers in general have high evasion, their fuel cost makes them incredibly useful as farming ships. Their self-heal ability also makes them the absolute tankiest destroyers over the course of multiple fights. Expect low damage output, but a generalist statline gives them relatively consistent performance on auto control, with decent anti-air output.

Ayanami
 - Role: Primo torpedo nuker; very high torpedo stat
 - Description: One of the strongest torpedo ships in the game. Requires good RNG and manual control for maximum output. Predominantly used for demolishing bosses and filling torpedo stat requirements.
 
Shigure
 - Role: Strong torpedo nuker; highest torpedo stat
 - Description: Highest torpedo stat in the game. Weaker torpedo output than Ayanami, but less RNG-reliant and somewhat tankier, making her more reliable (tho still suboptimal) on auto control. Gains bonuses when fielded with Yukikaze.

Kagerou
 - Role: Cheap torpedo nuker; very high torpedo stat
 - Description: Buffs the torpedo stat of all ships in the vanguard. While stat buffs like hers apply during combat and therefore are don't impact map stat requirements, it will boost the combat efficacy of any torpedo-equipped ship in the fleet alongside her, especially on manual control. Chain torpedo provides a slight boost to torpedo performance on auto control.

Shiranui
 - Role: Cheap torpedo nuker; very high torpedo stat
 - Description: Highest torpedo stat for a base white rarity DD. Provides little bonuses otherwise. Similar to Kagerou, chain torpedo provides a slight boost to torpedo performance on auto control.

Yukikaze
 - Role: Tanky torpedo nuker; very high torpedo stat
 - Description: One of the tankiest vanguard units in the game. Her complete lack of RNG elements aside from standard movement AI improves her performance on auto control, but prevents her from having output as high as the other torpedo nuke vanguard units.
 
Z23
 - Role: Tanky gunnery DD; very high general statline
 - Description: Has some of the strongest guns amongst destroyers. Her focus on such with a de-emphasis on torpedo damage greatly improves her performance on auto control. Highest firepower amongst destroyers (still low compared to other vanguard classes), very high anti-air and ASW stats. 
 
Javelin
 - Role: Tanky torpedo nuker; very high evasion stat and moderately high torpedo stat
 - Description: While her raw torpedo stat doesn't quite match that of her Japanese peers, Javelin's Assault Mode is an incredibly powerful skill, and equipping her with torpedoes that line up with that skill allow her torpedo damage to reach comparable levels of torpedo damage (note: final damage is calculated when the projectile contacts the enemy). Additionally, Javelin brings far superior gunnery damage than her Japanese peers and is a relatively tanky ship with the second highest raw evasion stat in the game.
 
Hammann
 - Role: Cheap anti-air platform; very high anti-air stat
 - Description: Strongest anti-air destroyer in the game, with access to relatively high efficiency, highest in class AA stat, and the anti-air mode skill. This paired with her flagship protection skill give Hammann a strong advantage when attempting to run especially lightweight fleets in any event with a strong enemy aviation presence. While her anti-air output falls behind that of many light cruisers, her most direct competitors are all more expensive to field than her, and the existence of ship locks will sometimes prevent you from fielding one of those light cruisers.

Kitakaze
 - Role: Primo gunnery destroyer; no stand-out stats
 - Description: While incredibly expensive and nowhere near the top of her class in any given stat relevant for event hardmodes, Kitakaze brings unparalleled damage output. Her ability to overwrite standard damage modifiers for destroyer guns allows her to excel in gunnery damage against medium and heavy armour opponents, giving her massive benefits over other destroyers in environments high in those armour types, especially on auto control. On top of this, she's one of the tankiest destroyers in the game, and still brings respectable torpedo output despite her gunnery focus.
