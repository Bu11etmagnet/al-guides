# Basics of PVE Fleet Composition
While the game is casual enough that most, if not all content can be cleared with whatever ships a player chooses, certain ground rules and guidelines must still be followed to ensure the generally efficacy of a given fleet. Equipment choices are covered in another guide. This guide is going to focus on what general types of ships should be chosen and how to organise a fleet for maximum throughput.

## Standard Ship Archetypes
In addition to the more clear-cut divisions between hull classifications, there are a number of soft divisions within those classes that are derived from a ship's general kit.

#### Battleships (BB) and Adjacent Classes<sup>†</sup> (BC/BM/BBV)
 - **3x Sheller** - This is the most generic battleship archetype and covers every battleship that gains +2 main gun mounts from limit breaks, for a total of three, hence 3x shelling. Generally considered the weakest archetype for direct damage dealing, 3x shelling BBs need especially strong skills, either personally or in the form of buffs or other utility, to be considered strong. Standout battleships in this category include North Carolina and Tirpitz.
 - **2x Sheller** - If 3x shelling BBs have three gun mounts, then logically 2x shelling BBs only have two. Battleships who fall in this category tend to have higher main gun efficiency to compensate. What this does is frontload the battleship's damage, which can cause more damage overall due to the way aiming AI works. In short, the first round of shelling will always prioritise boss and elite enemies, with following rounds of shelling having increasingly reduced boss priority. Additionally, having especially high main gun efficiency increases the potency of burn DOTs. This category includes ships like all current French battleships and Georgia.
 - **Barrager** - Battleships for whom a barrage skill constitutes the bulk of her throughput. This includes ships like Hood and all three monitors.
 - **Supporter** - This includes any battleship with a strong support skill. The strongest ships in this category are also going to fall into other archetypes, like Nagato who doubles as a support and barrage battleship, or Hyuuga, who is also an incredibly strong 2x sheller, but it also includes weaker ships like Queen Elizabeth, or Arizona, who is the only battleship capable of healing the vanguard.

 <sup>† In this guide, other guides, and common parliance in general, 'battleship' is used as a generic term to refer to all main fleet ships that occupy the role of dealing gunnery damage in bursts. While battleships and battlecruisers specifically are functionally identical in practical applications, monitors and battleship-carriers function slightly differently, but while still providing the same fundamental functionality.</sup>

#### Aircraft Carriers
 - **Plane Type Focus** - Nearly every carrier is going to have an affinity for one type of plane to the detriment of the others, which impacts use-case. Fighters are primarily used for aerial defence, with the best fighters dropping bombs, while both types of bombers are focused more on dealing damage. Torpedo bombers are further divided into aimed and parallel TBs, see the equipment guide for more information. Efficiencies and limit break perks are very important here. While Illustrious and Centaur both have two fighter slots and one torpedo bomber slot, Illustrious has higher efficiency on her fighters, and launches 6 of them to 2 torp. bombers. Centaur, meanwhile, has lower efficiency on her fighters and only launches 4 of them to 4 torp. bombers. This means Illustrious is a fighter-focused carrier while Centaur is a torpedo bomber-focused carrier.
 - **Paired Carriers** - At the time of writing this guide, there are only three strict sets of paired carriers: the Japanese Ikkousen, Nikkousen, and Gokkousen. All of them gain massive boosts to their statline when used together in the same fleet, which impacts their respective use-cases.
 - **High and Low Reload** - For the most part, reload stat correlates with a carrier being a light carrier or standard carrier, however some exceptions exist, such as Ranger. High reload carriers generally deal less damage than their slower counterparts, but their faster reload speed assists in the support role all carriers fill, and provides benefits with regards to reducing overkill when used in trash clearing fleets.
 - **Armoured Carrier** - At the time of writing this guide, there are only three armoured carriers: Illustrious, Victorious, and Taihou. Armoured carriers will generally deal less damage than standard carriers, compounded by also having low reload stats, but have heavy armour. Their thick armour and, in the case of Taihou and Victorious, strong defensive skills give them niche potential in select situations where you might run a carrier as your flagship, but also need them to be tanky. More on that below.
 - **Supporter** - Unlike battleships, where support-oriented ships are relatively rare, all carriers provide at least some form of support: airstrikes clear the screen of all projectiles. Additionally, proper supportive skills are very common. Shouhou and Unicorn both heal the vanguard, many carriers have the generic Fleet Carrier skill which boosts vanguard damage, Centaur boosts main fleet damage stats and slows enemies she hits with her barrage, et cetera.

#### Cruisers
 - **Torpedo Cruiser** - The most common type of cruiser, equipped with a single main gun and torpedoes. Torpedoes in general will struggle to perform at maximum potential when playing on auto, but are capable of dealing large amounts of damage on manual. Heavy torpedo cruisers tend to struggle as a result of this compounding on the incredibly low volume of fire from their main gun. Light torpedo cruisers will run into fewer issues with their gunnery, but generally lack damage potential compared to other classes.
 - **Gunboat** - The most common type of cruiser amongst USN ships, and relatively rare amongst other nations. These cruisers are equipped with main and auxiliary guns. In most cases, they receive main gun mount +1 and are equipped with destroyer auxiliary guns, but some exceptions exist. Yat Sen lacks a bonus main gun mount, but has two slots for main guns and no auxiliary gun. Seattle's auxiliary slot can support either an AA gun or light cruiser gun, but not a destroyer gun. London Kai's auxiliary slot can support either torpedoes or a destroyer gun, but she doesn't gain main gun mount +1. Gunboats will typically have lower potential output than torpedo cruisers, but their gunnery focus makes them superior on auto, and auxiliary guns shore up many of the weaknesses of heavy cruisers allowing gunboat heavy cruisers to perform more consistently as solo vanguard units than their torpedo-equipped peers.
 - **Hybrid Cruiser** - A rare subclass of cruisers, equipped with the main gun mount +1 of a gunboat, while still retaining their torpedoes. They tend to have the strongest damage potential, and, as most of them are gunnery focused, are still capable of pumping out large amounts of damage even on auto, though they do carry over the same caveat as traditional torpedo cruisers in that torpedoes are inherently unreliable on auto.
 - **AA Cruiser** - As the name would imply, AA cruisers are purpose-built to deal anti-air damage. Historically, they were equipped with dual-purpose guns, which is reflected in-game by their ability to equip destroyer guns (dual-purpose refers to light-caliber guns intended for both surface damage and anti-air roles, most of which fall under the in-game destroyer gun classification). Aside from their ability to equip destroyer guns, most AA cruisers are also equipped with torpedoes. Seattle is a special exception. While her kit is more in-line with those of a typical gunboat and she cannot equip destroyer guns at all, even in her auxiliary slot, her statline and skills are very explicitly geared towards being purpose-built to deal anti-air damage. Additionally, her historical gun is, despite being a light cruiser gun in-game, a dual-purpose gun, and even provides a small boost to anti-air.

#### Destroyers
Due to the general lack of variety in destroyer loadouts, there aren't any particularly apparent subclasses. Destroyers can be either **torpedo focused** or **gunnery focused** in a similar manner to torpedo and gunboat cruisers, but every gunnery focused destroyer still has her torpedoes, and many destroyers have a more balanced statline. Similar to with cruisers, gunnery focused destroyers will be somewhat more reliable and consistent on auto than torpedo focused destroyers. However, destroyers as a class are typically at their strongest when used on manual play.
