# When and Who to Limit Break
Limit breaks provide a substantial boost in power to your ships by increasing their stats and unlocking certain features. However, limit breaks do not spread power evenly, and certain ships will gain more from limit breaks than others.

## Limit Break Perks
For any given limit break, a ship will gain one or two perks and a boost to weapon efficiency.

### Gunnery Perks
 - **Full Barrage I and II** - All vanguard ships (with the exception of collab event units) gain a barrage at first limit break, and upgrade that barrage at third limit break. Barrage damage statistics generally depend on the class of the ship, with some ships having unique barrages.
 - **Main Gun Mount +1** - Main gun mount increases equip a ship with a ghost copy of whatever piece of equipment is in their main gun slot. These duplicate guns share all stats with the original copy, with the exception of any direct stats boosts. For any ship with this perk, the first bonus main gun mount is effectively going to double the amount of gunnery damage they deal, making it one of the most effective power spikes in the game. Most Eagle Union cruisers and select vanguard ships from other factions will gain main gun +1 at second limit break. Most battleships will gain main gun +1 at both first and third limit break, for a total of 3 gun mounts. However, some battleships only gain main gun +1 once. Additionally, certain ships will have their no. gun mounts altered by retrofits, especially those that change the ship's classification.
 - **Aux Weapon +1/+2** -
