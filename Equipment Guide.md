# PVE Equipment Guide
This guide is meant to serve as both an in-depth guide to end-game equipment and a quick reference to compare pieces of equipment in a given slot. Letter grades represent general usability of a given piece of equipment. While the general information is applicable to all servers, specific letter grades may vary slightly for EN server where some equipment does not exist.
 - **S-rank** equipment is going to be best-in-slot for most ships and in most use cases
 - **A-rank** equipment is either easier to acquire than S-rank equipment and good enough for general use, or is more difficult to obtain while not providing enough of an appreciable difference in performance to be worth recommending in all cases
 - **B-rank** equipment might not be strong enough to warrant a recommendation for general use, but occupies a specific niche that might make it best-in-slot for select scenarios or when equipped to certain ships

## Destroyer (DD) Guns
**General Primaries** <br/>

[![100mm Twin](/resources/100mm%20twin%20gr_b.png)]()

 - **[138mm Single Mle1929]()** is the hardest hitting DD gun in the game, to the point where it's worth using even on ships with relatively strong barrages, despite its relatively slow fire rate. It also gives the highest firepower boost of any DD gun.
 - **[120mm Twin QF Mark XII]()** is the strongest readily accessible general-use main gun. It has high damage output with an average reload speed for damage-focused guns, and great accuracy. Its only downside is normal shells deal drastically reduced damage against heavy armour enemies.
 - **[127mm Single Mk30]()** is the fastest firing HE gun, while also having very high damage stats. It's a good choice for destroyers with both strong barrages and high gunnery stats. Its mild accuracy problems reduce its direct gun dpm somewhat, making it a poor choice for destroyers with weak barrages.
 - **[127mm Twin Mk38]()** provides a split of firepower and anti-air boosts. While its damage is good, its low firepower boost and relatively slow rate of fire cause it to fall behind other, more accessible alternatives.
 - **[100mm Twin Type 98]()** is generally used on ships with strong barrages. However, its damage output isn't too far behind other alternatives against most targets and its volume of fire is higher than any other gun.

 [![120mm Single](/resources/120mm%20single%20gr_b.png)]()
 [![76mm Single](/resources/76mm%20single%20gr_b.png)]()
 
 - **[100mm Twin Type 98]()** has an incredibly fast fire rate while still having good damage and is the strongest readily accessible barrage-focused gun. It's a reliable gun for all destroyers with a strong barrage, even if another barrage-focused gun might be more optimal.
 - **[138mm Single Mle1929]()** makes up for its slow reload speed with sheer damage output and is best used on destroyers who have both strong barrages and high gunnery statistics.
 - **[127mm Single Mk30]()** is a decent and accessible gun for ships with strong barrages and high gunnery statistics. Its strongest use-case is an alternative to the 100mm T98 when fighting heavy armour bosses and the increased gunnery dpm makes up for the loss of barrage dpm.
 - **[120mm Single QF Mark IX]()** and **[76mm Single]()** are the fastest destroyer guns in the game and used on an incredibly small handful of ships who are willing to sacrifice nearly all gunnery dpm for faster barrage triggers and/or skill procs. The 120mm trades a very small amount of reload speed compared to the 76mm for higher base damage and longer range.
